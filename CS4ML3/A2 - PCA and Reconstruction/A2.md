#Assignment Two
This assignment focuses on Principal Component Analysis. We take faces from the `lfw_people` dataset from the `scikit-learn` `Python3` library and explore how PCA can be used
to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining its usefulness. We see how using different components adjusts how close the reconstruction is to the original images.

For the statistics portion of this assignment, we explore probability, specifically starting with Maximum Likelihood Estimators, and deriving formulas and equations to get the correct values for such values.
