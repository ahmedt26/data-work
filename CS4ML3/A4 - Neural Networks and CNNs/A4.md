# Assignment Four - Neural Nets
In this assignment we attempt to denoise hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset using a neural network. We explore both linear networks and using
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to see which one is better at denoising.

We also explore how tuning parameters like epochs and learning rate affect the
performance of the model, and how they contribute to a model's performance.
